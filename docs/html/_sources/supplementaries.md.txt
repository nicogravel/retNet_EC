**Figure S1. Combining power and phase information enhances MV-TFR.** *When derived from power, MV-TFR captures more stimulus related information than when derived from phase estimates (GPR), albeit this relationship may be reversed for lower frequencies. Combining power and phase estimates (GPR) increased the sensitivity of the TFR to stimulus related information.*

**Figure S2. Laminar profile of MV-TFR differ when obtained from power, phase or both.** *When emphasizing laminar profiles, power seems to be more specific and capture more stimulus related information than phase alone (GPR).*

**Figure S3. Cross-depth RSA for power and GPR combined.** *When emphasizing laminar profiles, power seems to be more specific and capture more stimulus related information than phase alone (GPR).*
