<p><strong>Temporal evolution of image-related information measured using RSA.</strong> Top block correspond to gratings and bottom ones to naturalistic images (objects with and without background). <em>Left block:</em> Multi-variate time-frequency representations (representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM)- based correlation maps) obtained for frequencies between 80-200 Hz,  20 - 80 Hz and 2 - 20 Hz. Results are for data from all sessions combined. Correlation values were averaged across depths. As such, these TFRs provide a grand average but hide information that may be present on specific depths. <em>Right block:</em> Depth-time RDM correlation maps obtained from MUA (top panel), and for different frequency bands after averaging the correlation values over defined frequency range (85 - 185 Hz for middle-top, 35 - 70 Hz for middle-bottom and 3 9 Hz for bottom sub panels, correspond to high-gamma, gamma and theta, respectively). The dotted red trace indicate the p &lt; 0.005 cutoff.</p>

<p>TFRs were obtained as follows. For each site and trial, local field potential responses (bipolar-LFP was computed as the difference between every second site) were time-frequency decomposed using a single Hanning window for 2-20 Hz and 80-200 Hz, and Wavelet tapers for the range between 20 and 80 Hz. Subsequently, the spectral power (normalized against baseline) and the goodness of phase relationship (computed using Euler’s sum of exponent’s rule) were taken as combined set of features for the decoding of image identity (using linear discriminant analysis). Even and odd trials were classified separately. This resulted, for each frequency bin and time window, in an <em>image x image</em> matrix of classification accuracy values. The lower triangle minus the diagonal of these decoding accuracy matrices were turned into a vector and compared using Spearman’s rho with random tie-breaking (as in Schütt et al., 2023). This resulted, for each time window, in RDM-based correlation maps that were based on frequency-specific image-related information, as opposed to univariate time-frequency representations that reflect ongoing dynamics, including measurement artifacts. To assess the contribution of the representational structure determined by the stimulus to the time-frequency RDM correlation map, we used a permutation approach, as follows. For each frequency and time bin, we permuted the columns of the RDM obtained from the even-trials and then computed correlation with the RDM obtained from the odd-trials (and <em>vice versa</em>). This procedure was repeated 500 times for both splits, resulting in 1000 null correlation values. We then take <em>p &lt; 0.005</em> cutoff as the 99.5 % percentage of the resulting null distribution.</p>

<p>By decoding stimulus identity from  MUA responses and bipolar-LFP time-frequency responses (estimated as the combination of spectral power and the goodness of fit relationship), we obtained cross-validated RDM correlation maps for MUA, bipolar-LFP in the high-gamma, gamma and theta bands in the form of time-frequency and depth-time representations. We did this for gratings and naturalistic images (objects with and without context background).</p>

<p>For the spectral estimates averaged across depths, we find that the representational structure (stimulus related information) that emerges from the RDM correlation maps reveal, both for gratings and naturalistic images, an increase in the gamma band (central panel in left block). The bandwidth of this increase in the representational structure in gamma was wider for grating than for naturalistic images (top-central panel in left block). In contrast, for the higher and lower frequency ranges, responses to naturalistic images seemed to carry more stimulus related information than those representational structures obtained from gratings. For naturalistic images, the RDM correlation maps for the lower frequency band revealed stimulus related information emerging right after the initial evoked responses and lasting about 100 ms, whereas the high frequency band revealed a weak but significant increase, which was absent for gratings.</p>

<p>The grand average time-frequency charts summarize the RDM correlation maps across all depths. To scrutinize the unfolding contribution to the representational structure of different depths, RDM correlation maps for each depth were averaged (between 85 -  185 Hz for high-gamma, 35-70 for gamma, and 3-9 for theta) and shown as a function of time (right block). To compare the representational structure found in high-gamma, gamma and theta to that obtained for MUA, we also show the RDM correlation maps obtained from MUA for each depth as a function of time (top panel in right blocks). The RDM correlation maps revealed laminar patterns in the unfolding representational structure, with MUA following  sub-granular and supra-granular layers later in the trial (200 - 1200 ms). This pattern was observed both for gratings and naturalistic images, although this structure was stronger for naturalistic images. For high-gamma, only naturalistic images gave rise to representational structure, with RDM correlation maps being flat for gratings. Remarkably, for naturalistic images, this representational structure started in sub-granular and supra-granular layers, yet unfolded mostly on superficial, supra-granular layers. Gamma activity revealed a different picture, with both gratings and naturalistic-images giving rise to a similar pattern in the representational structure. This structure shaped up from an initial increase comprising sub-granular, granular and supra-granular layers, followed by a decrease in granular layers and a subsequent increase in sub-granular and supra-granular but not in granular layers. Whereas, for gratings, both sub-granular and supra-granular layers carried on a great extent of stimulus related information, for naturalistic images mostly supra-granular layers carried stimulus related information, with stimulus related information in sub-granular and deep layers emerging later in the trial. For theta, a similar pattern was found both for gratings and naturalistic images. This pattern comprised an initial increase, widespread across depths, but higher in supra-granular and granular layers, with a sustained yet weak persistence of the representational structure in these same depths.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">3.4. </span>Interpretations:<a class="headerlink" href="#interpretations" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Image structure and behavioural relevance of the image are known to engage different mechanisms along the visual processing stream, with V1 responses discriminating image structure in the gamma band (Brunet et al, 2019), as well as in the high-gamma band (xyz ?). Here we find that, both for gratings and naturalistic images (<em>objects</em>), gamma was strongly discriminative of stimulus related information, with a wider bandwidth seen for gratings. In contrast, high-gamma was only discriminative for naturalistic images (<em>objects</em>). Our results extend on previous findings using surface electrodes (Hermes,  Brunet, …) that showed an increase in the contribution of high-frequency activity during object perception. Here we show that gamma is indeed discriminative of stimulus structure. However, we show this also for high-gamma. By using laminar recordings, we demonstrate that high-gamma differentially discriminate objects but not gratings, pointing to the contribution of behaviourally relevant processes such as background segmentation and object recognition to the observed neuronal activity. These processes are known to depend on feedback modulations unfolding later in the trial. We speculate that this is indeed reflected in high-gamma appearing in supra-granular and infra-granular layers. Whereas in our study we did not control for receptive field position and therefore the overlap with the stimulus aperture and the image was not controlled, we cannot fully discern whether feedback modulations during background segmentation played a significant role. However, <span style="color:red"> we think this may be the case as … now include the degree of focus on the story and separate objects + and - context (background…)</span></p>
