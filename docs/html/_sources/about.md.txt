**Ph.D., Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience**  
*August 2013 to April 2018*   
University of Groningen, The Netherlands.  

**L.Sc. in Science degree in Biology**  
*March 2004 to December 2009*

**Postdoctoral Researcher**  
*April 2019 to present*  
Mechanisms and Functions of Rhythmic Neuronal Synchronization, *Ernst StrÃ¼ngmann Institute for Neuroscience*, Frankfurt. Germany.  
Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition, Department of Education and Psychology, *Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin*. Germany.  

**In my current project**, I investigate electrophysiological laminar-specific responses to visual stimuli using a multivariate pattern classification approach and biologically inspired modeling techniques. My aim is to relate the insights revealed by these to neuronal responses indirectly observed using laminar fMRI. I am particularly interested in disentangling feedforward, lateral and feedback interactions across the visual system during the processing of naturalistic stimuli. ðŸ‘€ ðŸ§
