abstract = {{The interlaminar connections in the primate primary visual cortex (V1) are well described, as is the presence of ongoing alpha-range (7–14 Hz) fluctuations in this area. Less well understood is how these interlaminar connections and ongoing fluctuations contribute to the regulation of visual spiking responses. Here, we investigate the relationship between alpha fluctuations and spiking responses to visual stimuli across cortical layers. Using laminar probes in macaque V1, we show that neural firing couples with the phase of alpha fluctuations, and that magnitude of this coupling is particularly pronounced during visual stimulation. The strongest modulation of spiking activity was observed in layers 2/3. Alpha-spike coupling and current source density analysis pointed to an infragranular origin of the alpha fluctuations. Taken together, these results indicate that ongoing infragranular alpha-range fluctuations in V1 play a role in regulating columnar visual activity.}},

abstract = {{Attention to a stimulus enhances both neuronal responses and gamma frequency synchrony in visual area V4, both of which should increase the impact of attended information on downstream neurons. To determine whether gamma synchrony is common throughout the ventral stream, we recorded from neurons in the superficial and deep layers of V1, V2, and V4 in two rhesus monkeys. We found an unexpected striking difference in gamma synchrony in the superficial vs. deep layers. In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40–60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers, whereas the deep layers showed maximal coherence at low frequencies (6–16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers. The results suggest that synchrony plays very different roles in feedback and feedforward projections.}},

abstract = {{This paper reviews some of the recent neurophysiological studies that explore the variety of visual computations in the early visual cortex in relation to geometric inference, i.e. the inference of contours, surfaces and shapes. It attempts to draw connections between ideas from computational vision and findings from awake primate electrophysiology. In the classical feed-forward, modular view of visual processing, the early visual areas (LGN, V1 and V2) are modules that serve to extract local features, while higher extrastriate areas are responsible for shape inference and invariant object recognition. However, recent findings in primate early visual systems reveal that the computations in the early visual cortex are rather complex and dynamic, as well as interactive and plastic, subject to influence from global context, higher order perceptual inference, task requirement and behavioral experience. The evidence argues that the early visual cortex does not merely participate in the first stage of visual processing, but is involved in many levels of visual computation.}},

abstract = {{The primary visual cortex (V1) is widely regarded as faithfully conveying the physical properties of visual stimuli. Thus, experience-induced changes in V1 are often interpreted as improving visual perception (i.e., perceptual learning). Here we describe how, with experience, cue-evoked oscillations emerge in V1 to convey expected reward time as well as to relate experienced reward rate. We show, in chronic multisite local field potential recordings from rat V1, that repeated presentation of visual cues induces the emergence of visually evoked oscillatory activity. Early in training, the visually evoked oscillations relate to the physical parameters of the stimuli. However, with training, the oscillations evolve to relate the time in which those stimuli foretell expected reward. Moreover, the oscillation prevalence reflects the reward rate recently experienced by the animal. Thus, training induces experience-dependent changes in V1 activity that relate to what those stimuli have come to signify behaviorally: when to expect future reward and at what rate.}},

abstract = {{The brain directs its limited processing resources through various selection mechanisms, broadly referred to as attention. The present study investigated the temporal dynamics of two such selection mechanisms: space- and object-based selection. Previous evidence has demonstrated that preferential processing resulting from a spatial cue (i.e., space-based selection) spreads to uncued locations if those locations are part of the same object (i.e., resulting in object-based selection), but little is known about the relationship between these fundamental selection mechanisms. Here, we used human behavioral data to determine how space- and object-based selection simultaneously evolve under conditions that promote sustained attention at a cued location, varying the cue-to-target interval from 300 to 1100 ms. We tracked visual-target detection at a cued location (i.e., space-based selection), at an uncued location that was part of the same object (i.e., object-based selection), and at an uncued location that was part of a different object (i.e., in the absence of space- and object-based selection). The data demonstrate that even under static conditions, there is a moment-to-moment reweighting of attentional priorities based on object properties. This reweighting is revealed through rhythmic patterns of visual-target detection both within (at 8 Hz) and between (at 4 Hz) objects.}},

abstract = {{The hippocampus supports memory encoding and retrieval, which may occur at distinct phases of the theta cycle. These processes dynamically interact over rapid timescales, especially when sensory information conflicts with memory. The ability to link hippocampal dynamics to memory-guided behaviors has been limited by experiments that lack the temporal resolution to segregate encoding and retrieval. Here, we simultaneously tracked eye movements and hippocampal field potentials while neurosurgical patients performed a spatial memory task. Phase-locking at the peak of theta preceded fixations to retrieved locations, indicating that the hippocampus coordinates memory-guided eye movements. In contrast, phase-locking at the trough of theta followed fixations to novel object-locations and predicted intact memory of the original location. Theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling increased during fixations to conflicting visual content, but predicted memory updating. Hippocampal theta thus supports learning through two interleaved processes: strengthening encoding of novel information and guiding exploration based on prior experience.}},
