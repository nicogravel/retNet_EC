<h2>Experimental design<a class="headerlink" href="#experimental-design" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We conducted two independent experiments. In experiment 1, we investigated laminar profiles of contrast sensitivity and orientation selectivity using a multivariate approach and compare these to results obtained using classical univariate measures. In experiment 2, we investigated the contribution to figure-ground segregation of laminar recording using the temporal generalisation method (King and Dehaene 2014), an approach based on multivariate pattern analysis aimed to disentangle the contribution of different representational structures to visual processing across time.</p>
<p>The general aim of the experiments was to benchmark our multivariate pattern analysis approach to analyse laminar electrophysiological data to provide a ground truth for similar approaches using laminar fMRI data. One monkey participated so far in the experiments.</p>
<p>The experiments consisted of four blocks. The first two blocks were to align depth recordings from different sessions to a common laminar depth reference and to compute receptive field. In the first block, we used MUA and CSD laminar responses to full field flashes to help us identifying the granular to sub-granular transition in each session. This helped us align sessions based on CSD reversal patterns and the early MUA response associated with thalamic inputs to layer 4c and 6 (Nicholson and Freeman 1975). In the second block, we used MUA and gamma band LFP responses to standard receptive field mapping task to compute receptive field (RF) estimates for each depth probe’s channel. This provided us with quantitative estimates of receptive field sizes, the stability of visual field position selectivity across channels (whether recordings were parallel to cortical columns), as well as with the localisation of grey matter boundaries. In the third block, we estimated orientation tuning and contrast sensitivity using grating stimuli of different orientations and contrasts. In the last block, we presented naturalistic images consisting of objects within and without background . In all blocks, each trial starts with the presentation of a central fixation point (a small black dot 4 pixels in diameter superimposed on a larger white circle 0.5 deg in diameter). The monkey has 10 sec to initiate central fixation, otherwise the fixation point disappears and an inter-trial interval of 700 ms starts. During the whole trial, the monkey has to keep his eyes within the fixation window (with a radius of 1.2 deg) in order to receive reward. When the monkey initiates fixation, a baseline period of 900 to 1000 ms starts which is then followed by the presentation of a visual stimulus for 1300 to 1500 ms. The monkey was rewarded with grape juice at the end of the trial for maintaining fixation within the fixation window during the whole trial duration (2200 to 3500 ms in total).</p>
<p>In the first block, each trial starts with the presentation of a white fixation point on a black background. After successful fixation, a baseline period of 1000-1500 ms starts, followed by a sequence of brief full-field flashes. The background changed three times from black to white (white screen for 50 ms, followed by a black screen for 500 ms). In the second block, receptive field (RF) mapping stimuli consisted of a rectangular bar drifting at eight mirroring diagonal orientations. Receptive field maps were computed by correlating the MUA and gamma band LFP responses with stimulus position. For details see (Fiorani et al. 2014). In the third block, gratings of 3 cycles per degree of visual angle were presented at six different orientations (30, 60, 90, 120, 180 degrees) and five contrasts (Michelson contrasts of 6,  12.5, 25, 50 and 100 %) within a circular aperture (4 degrees in diameter) located in the lower-right quadrant of the visual field (centred diagonally at 4 degrees of visual eccentricity). A baseline condition was included (10% of the trials), in which there is no stimulus presentation. At the end of each baseline trial, the monkey is again rewarded for keeping on fixating for 2200 to 3500 ms in total (Fig 1A). On each trial, the presented stimulus is randomly selected from a pool of stimuli that have either not been presented before, or from those that have been presented but have not yet reached the number of minimum presentations. The block ends when a predefined number of correct trials (here 10 per stimulus per penetration session) has been reached (a minimum of 300 hit trials were recorded). Gamma correction was applied to the gratings. The last block was similar to the grating stimuli block but included a set of 18 naturalistic objects, both within or without background (Fig 1E. A minimum of 360 hit trials were recorded). Gamma correction was not applied in this last block. Visual stimuli were generated using MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.) and presented in a CRT monitor using the ARCADE  (ESI Inc.) software. Timing was controlled using ARCADE.</p>

<section id="electrophysiological-recordings">
<h2>Electrophysiological recordings<a class="headerlink" href="#electrophysiological-recordings" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Experiments were performed on adult Macaca mulatta male specimens. Extracellular recordings were made in the bottom left parafoveal representation (2-5 deg of eccentricity) of the primary visual cortex (upper bank in the right hemisphere’s calcarine sulcus) using  24-channel linear electrode arrays (Plexon V-probe, contact diameter: 15 um, inter-contact spacing: 100 um. Five penetrations were performed using 150 um V-probes and data interpolated to a common 100 um grid). The recording chamber consisted of a 2-dimensional grid hole array covering different parafoveal representations (Fig 1). In each session, the probe was advanced through a different gridhole perpendicular to the cortical surface in a guide-tube with a blunt tip mounted on a hydraulic micro-drive (Narishige) at a speed of 10 um/sec until it touched the dura. The probe was then advanced at 1um/sec through the dura, until neuronal activity was present in most contacts. Raw neuronal data were recorded using a Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT) amplifier system at a sampling rate of 24.414,06 KHz. Multiunit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFP) were obtained using online analog Butterworth filters (gain=1) in the TDT amplifier system. To obtain the LFP signals, the raw data was filtered using a high-pass filter at 2 Hz followed by a low-pass filter at 300 Hz. Time series for MUA were obtained by using a high-pass filtering above 300 Hz followed by a low-pass filtering at 5 KHz, taking the absolute value and subsequently low-pass filtering the rectified time courses at 150 Hz. LFP, MUA and  photodiode signals were then sampled at 1017.25 Hz. At the end of the session, the probe was retracted for about 500 um (speed: 1um/sec) in order to avoid dimples in the cortical tissue. Similar procedures can be found in Nandy et al. (2017) (Nandy, Nassi, and Reynolds 2017). The waiting time between the last movement of the probe and beginning of the recording was at least 30 min. To ensure accurate fixation, eye behaviour from the left eye was recorded at 1000 Hz with an Eyelink 1000 system and calibrated at the beginning of each session.</p>
<section id="processing-of-electrophysiological-data">
<h3>Processing of electrophysiological data<a class="headerlink" href="#processing-of-electrophysiological-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>All analyses were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks) and used the FieldTrip toolbox (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) (Oostenveld et al., 2011). Raw signals were low-pass filtered at 250 Hz and downsampled from 3.05 kHz to 1 kHz. To remove the common recording reference, we subtracted signals from neighboring electrodes from each other, and refer to the resulting bipolar derivation as a (recording) site; This reduced the data from 6 electrodes to 5 sites. A 60 Hz notch filter was applied during recording (Fig. 2; gray shaded areas). No further data selection or pre-treatment, like artifact rejection, was performed. For each of the 432 trials, we extracted a baseline epoch from 0.5 to 0 s, and a stimulation epoch from 0.3 to 0.8 s with respect to stimulus onset (red lines in Fig. 2B). The first 0.3 s after stimulus onset were discarded to minimize the influence of strong response onset transients and the corresponding non-stationarities in the signals. The data epochs were Hann tapered and Fourier transformed, covering a range from 4 to 200 Hz in steps of 2 Hz.</p>
<p>To account for baseline fluctuations in the recordings, both local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recordings were normalized using data from the baseline trials, as follows.
First, both LFP and MUA, time courses from all trials were temporally aligned with the stimulus onset and resampled at 1000 Hz. Second, for each channel’s LFP or MUA signal, the mean of all baseline trials for the channel was subtracted from the trial’s signal and the resulting time courses divided by the standard deviation of all baseline trials. This resulted in a set of baseline corrected z-scored signals. Third, for each trial and channel, baseline-corrected data was rescaled by subtracting the minimum across all channels and then dividing the result by the difference between the maximum and the minimum amplitude across all channels. This last step was applied only for MUA time courses, since their magnitude and units are relative to baseline fluctuations. This facilitated the comparison of MUA responses between all channels. The normalization resulted in LFP and MUA time courses measured as microvolts and normalized arbitrary units, respectively.</p>

<section id="laminar-alignment">
<h3>Laminar alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#laminar-alignment" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To relate the recordings channels obtained with the V-probes to the layered neuroanatomical structure of V1, we estimated the current source density (CSD) in response to a sequence of brief flashes in contrast (see Section 2.1. for details). By considering the cortical depth tissue as a stack of isopotential planes, the CSD estimates extracellular current flow across the laminar tissue (Nicholson and Freeman 1975). If the LFP is recorded with a linear micro-array of evenly spaced contacts, and the probe penetration is perpendicular to the cortical surface, the second spatial derivative of the LFP can be taken to be proportional to the extracellular current flow, which is captured by the CSD (voltage/area). The spatiotemporal organisation of current sinks and sources in the CSD is thought to reflect local synaptic activity (Buzsáki, Anastassiou, and Koch 2012). A key feature used to locate the transition between laminæ 4 and  is a conspicuous current sink associated with thalamic afferent inputs to the granular layers of the primary visual cortex. This feature landmark is typically but not always associated with an early (~40 ms) and transient increase in MUA circumscribed to layer 4c, consequence of the same thalamic afferents giving rise to the CSD sink. Whenever a session did not provide us with a clear picture of this CSD sink, we took the transient early increase in MUA as a pointer to the granular/infragranular transition, and shifted the probes accordingly. Using this approach, penetrations obtained both with 150 um and 100 um spacing V-probes were zeroed to the granular/infragranular transition. After alignment, data obtained from the 150 um spacing probes were upsampled by linear interpolation to a common 100 um grid, resulting in a laminar dataset comprising depths ranging from +/- 600 um (1200 um) with a common spacing of 100 um, which amounts to 13 laminar recordings per penetration. Ten penetrations were made for the grating stimuli (130 recording sites) and eleven for the natural images (143 recording sites). Interpolating aligned data to a common space provided us with enough data to perform our multivariate analyses, as well as a common space for analyses performed at the channel level. We note that RF and correlations across depths can (and will) be used for further grouping of the data into depth compartments. Also, discarding probes that were too deep or too shallow can allow a greater coverage of grey matter (e.g. +/- &gt;700 um).</p>

<section id="relative-degree-of-focus">
<h2>Relative Degree of Focus<a class="headerlink" href="#relative-degree-of-focus" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many measures exist to estimate the local spatial structure on an image. One such measures is the degree of focus. Here we follow the method presented by Brunet et al, (2016), who hypothesized that the Discrete Cosine Transform energy may correlate with gamma activity induced within the receptive field. Specifically, we computed the  DCT energy of a section of each image in the stimulus set that overlapped with each recording site’s receptive field (RF). To do so, we proceeded as follows. For each recording site, the centre and radius of its RF (see Section X for details on how the RF’s were computed) were used to extract, for each imager, pixels located within a square centred at the RF’s centre with the square dimensions determined by half the RF’s radius. This provided us with a section of the image overlapping with the site’s RF which was large enough compute a meaningful estimate of its DCT energy. The DCT energy was computed after transforming the pixel’s RG values to gray scale.  We then examined the relationship between the resulting DCT energy estimates and the spectral frequency distribution of the each recording site.</p>
<p>To quantify the degree of image structure, we employed a class of operators from computer vision, which are all intended to capture the Relative Degree of Focus (RDF) in an image. The RDF can be computed for any luminance image and therefore constitutes an image-computable metric (Schütt and Wichmann, 2017). The underlying assumption is that a focused image presents more sharp edges than an image that is out of focus. In order to quantify the RDF of a given image, a focus measure operator is used to calculate the focus level for every pixel of the image (Pertuz et al., 2013). Different approaches have been used to design focus measure operators. While some emphasize sharp versus blurred edges, such as the gradient-based operators, others measure frequency and spatial content of the image, such as wavelet-based operators. To avoid edge effects, the operator output was used for the central 80% of the image in both vertical and horizontal dimensions, ignoring 10% of the images close to all their edges. The correlation between gamma-band activity of site 3 and the RDF is illustrated for one example operator, namely the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) Energy measure, in Fig. 4A and B. We list the correlation for various other RDF operators in</p>
