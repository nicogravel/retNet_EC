**Relative degree of focus within the receptive fields.** Many measures exist to estimate the local spatial structure on an image. One such measures is the relative degree of focus. Here we follow the method presented by Brunet et al, (2016), who hypothesized that the Discrete Cosine Transform energy may correlate with gamma activity induced within the receptive field. Specifically, we computed the  DCT energy of a section of each image in the stimulus set that overlapped with each recording site's receptive field (RF). To do so, we proceeded as follows. For each recording site, the centre and radius of its RF (see Section X for details on how the RF's were computed) were used to extract, for each imager, pixels located within a square centred at the RF's centre with the square dimensions determined by half the RF's radius. This provided us with a section of the image overlapping with the site's RF which was large enough compute a meaningful estimate of its DCT energy. The DCT energy was computed after transforming the pixel's RG values to gray scale.  We then examined the relationship between the resulting DCT energy estimates and the spectral frequency distribution of the each recording site.
