The decoding of neuronal activity across cortical layers remains poorly understood
Few studies have examined how decoding from LFP depends on cortical depth {cite:p}`Markowitz.2011`.

It has been established  {cite:p}`Zold.2015`.
Some studies {cite:p}`Kragel.2020,Fiebelkorn.2013` have suggest. For instance {cite:t}`Fiebelkorn.2013` proposed an alternative hypothesis.
