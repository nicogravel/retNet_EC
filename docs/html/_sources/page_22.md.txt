**Different laminar distributions of image-related information for MUA, high-gama, gamma and theta.** *For gratings (left) and naturalistic images (right). MUA-derived image-related information was increased for responses to naturalistic images, as  compared to that obtained for gratings. In both conditions, image-related information followed a similar laminar pattern with sub-granular and supra-granular layers persisting over the course of the trial while avoiding the granular layer. For naturalistic images, however, supra-granular layers carried more image-related information. For RDMs averaged between 85-185 Hz, little laminar specificity was found, with the exception of a subtle presence of image-related information in the supra-granular layers for responses to naturalistic images. For RDMs averaged between 35 - 80 Hz, image-information content followed mostly sub-granular layers for gratings and, in stark contrast, mostly supra-granular layers for responses to naturalistic images. For RDM averaged between 3 and 9 Hz, image-related information content followed a similar pattern than that observed for MUA, with image-related information following sub-granular and supra-granular layers and, for responses to naturalistic images, also supra-granular layers. Results are for data from ten sessions combined.*



### Findings:
* Image-related information spectral content maps to distinct lamina.

### Results:
* Responses for naturalistic images show more image-related information content in the supra-granular layers.

### Interpretations:
*  This results point to feedback.
