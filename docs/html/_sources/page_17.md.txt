**Relative degree of focus within the receptive fields.** Many measures exist to estimate the local spatial structure on an image. One such measures is the relative degree of focus. Here we follow the method presented by Brunet et al, (2016), who hypothesized that the Discrete Cosine Transform energy may correlate with activity induced within the receptive field. Specifically, we computed the  DCT energy of a section of each image in the stimulus set that overlapped with each recording site's receptive field (RF). To do so, we proceeded as follows. For each recording site in a session (after alignment to the granular layer), the centre and radius of the site's RF (see Section X for details on how the RF's were computed) were used to extract, for each image, the pixels located within a square centred at the RF's centre (with the square dimensions determined by half the RF's radius). This provided us with a section of the image overlapping with the site's RF which was large enough to compute a meaningful estimate of its DCT energy. Subsequently, the image's sections transformed to grayscale and the DCT energy was computed.  We then examined the relationship between the resulting DCT energy estimates and theta, gamma, high-gamma and MUA of the each recording site.

**Relative Degree of Focus across laminar depth negatively correlates with RF size.** Receptive field sizes in supra- and infra- granular layers of V1 are known to be larger than these found in granular layers (Self et al, 2013, also in our dataset). In our dataset, larger RFs integrate over regions of the image that included the gray pixels outside the stimulus aperture. Since we calculated the relative degree of focus for image patches overalping with the recording sites RF, smaller RFs are expected to capture image only information, as opposed to larger RFs that overlap with the gray voxels outside the stimulus aperture.

**Correlation between relative degree of focus within the receptive field (RF-RDG) and spectral power across depth as a function of time.** *Left:* For objects in context, the correlation between RF-RDG and spectral power in the theta band is higher than that obtained for objects with no context. *Center:* For objects in full context, the correlation between  RF-RDG and spectral power in the gamma band is lower than that obtained for objects with no context. *Right:* For objects in full context, the correlation between RF-RDG and spectral power in the high gamma band is lower than that obtained for objects with no context. These opposing patterns point to a differential spatial distribution of theta and gamma activity. Gamma activity in supra- and infra- granular is higher than that found in granular layers whereas RDF is higher in granular layers. Since gamma activity is known to be highly localized, negative correlations between RDF and gamma are to be expected, especially for full context images were the overlap with the RF is larger. In contrast, theta activity seems to be positively correlated, which may point to the inhibitory nature of the slow activity in the periphery of the RF.
